	 * A callback-based version of [[`pipeAsync`]]. Creates a pipeline of steps where the first step produces the data and then 
	   * it flows to the next step and so on. The first step is the source, producing the content, the final step is the sink.
	 *  
	 * The type definitions make this look daunting.  It's not.  It's merely a set of pipeline steps in a series where
	 * the first step in the pipeline is the source that produces content, perhaps by reading it from a queue of the bus,
	 * and then the data is sent to the next step and so on until the final step, the sink, gets the data.
	 * 
	 * The reason the types look so complicated is because there must be a specific type for the exact sequence of
	 * possible pipeline steps that one might chain together.  The different parameterized types, T1/T2/etc., represent
	 * the data type of the data events that are produced and are modified and move down through the pipe.
	 * 
	 * Note that developers don't really need to understand hardly any of this.  Developers need only ask what type
	 * of pipe they want to create.  Do I want a pipe that just reads from a queue and doesn't send it anywhere else?
	 * Well, that's an [[`RStreamsSdk.offload`]] pipe.  Do you want to read from one queue, do some processing and/or
	 * transformation and/or filtering and then write the result to another queue?  Well that's an [[`RStreamsSdk.enrich`]] or
	 * [[`RStreamsSdk.enrichEvents`]].  With these, you don't have to construct a pipe yourself as these helper methods
	 * craft one purpose-built for you.
	 * 
	 * If you need to do something more involved then this method is for you.  Even then, the SDK dramatically simplifies things
	 * so you don't have to craft your own pipeline steps.  Instead, you simply call an SDK function to create an instance
	 * of a pipeline step that does what you want it to.
	 *

	 * @todo incomplete need to do a lot more here to describe all the pipeline steps and how errors work and so forth.  Probably should link out to the rstreams.org site.
